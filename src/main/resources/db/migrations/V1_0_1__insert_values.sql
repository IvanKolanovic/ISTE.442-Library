        'Howard Phillips "H.P." Lovecraft was a professional writer from Providence, Rhode Island. He specialized in writing so-called "weird fiction", a term used for stories which combined elements from fantasy, horror fiction, and science fiction. He is primarily remembered as the founder of the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared fictional universe involving both his own works and those of several other writers who collaborated with him. His works were influenced by his adherence to the philosophy of Cosmicism, the belief that "humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence". He died when only 46-years-old, but continues to have an influence on modern fiction. The term "Lovecraftian horror" is used for modern works influenced by his ideas.',

VALUES ('Animal Farm', 'Political satire',
        'The poorly-run Manor Farm near Willingdon, England, is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer, Mr. Jones. One night, the exalted boar, Old Major, holds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called "Beasts of England". When Old Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property "Animal Farm". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, "All animals are equal". The decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (later dubbed the "Battle of the Cowshed"), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill. Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to head, which culminate in Napoleon''s dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon declaring himself supreme commander.',
